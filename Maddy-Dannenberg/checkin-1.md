## Project Name:
Finish Your Fifty

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?)
1

#### Project Pitch
An app for runners with the goal to run a race in every state. The app will provide a way for them to easily see which states have been completed and search races in states that have not yet been completed.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
React.js, React Router, Redux

#### APIs: 
Active.com

#### Wireframes
[Home Page Wireframe]('./Images/FYF---Wireframe-Home-Page.jpg')

[Log Page Wireframe]('./Images/FYF---Wireframe-Home-Page.jpg')

#### Waffle & Github

#### Order Of Attack
Phase 1 - Set up file structure, make initial API call, clean data, set up U.S. state map.

#### MVP
Input for user to log states and map with visual indication of what states have been completed. Ability to search for races in states still needed.

#### Nice To Haves
Log race time, distance, shoes worn, reflection; Map view and list view; Filter which states user has run a given distance in (ie marathon, 10k); search races by city and date range; Pin city ran was run in 

#### Biggest Challenges
Building a map with dynamic highlighted regions
